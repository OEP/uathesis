# The University of Alabama Thesis Template

This is a LaTeX template for students writing a thesis at The University of
Alabama. This is the class file I created and ended up using for my MS work.
It is a reverse-engineering of the style guidelines posted by the graduate
school. I worked from this guideline:

## Basic Usage

1. Include the document class

    \usepackage[thesis]{uathesis}

OR

    \usepackage[dissertation]{uathesis}

See the included example file.
